  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `images` on the `Product` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `visible` on the `Product` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to alter the column `price` on the `Product` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Decimal(10,2)` to `DoublePrecision`.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[slug]` on the table `Product` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `slug` to the `Product` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
